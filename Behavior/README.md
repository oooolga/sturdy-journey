# Behavior Interview

## The STAR Method
To give a polish response, try to follow the following framework:
| Component | Purpose                    | What to Include |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Situation | Set the stage.             |Provide brief context. What was the project? Who were you working with? Keep this to 1–2 sentences. |
| Task      | Define the challenge.      | "What was the specific problem or goal? What was at stake? Mention any constraints (e.g., memory limits or a tight deadline)." |
| Action    | What YOU did.              | "This is the most important part (60% of your answer). Use ""I,"" not ""we."" Explain your logic, the tools used (e.g., PyTorch, Euler solvers), and how you overcame obstacles." |
| Result    | The outcome.               | "What happened? Use quantifiable metrics if possible (e.g., ""reduced inference time by 20%"" or ""improved PSNR by 2dB""). What did you learn?" |


## Example Questions
1. Tell me about a time you worked on a project and realized midway through that your original approach or hypothesis was wrong. How did you handle that realization?
2. Tell me about a time when you had a significant technical disagreement with a teammate or a supervisor. How did you present your case, and what was the resolution?
3. Tell me about a time you received tough or critical feedback from a teammate or manager.
4. Describe a time when you had to start a project with very limited resources or data. How did you decide where to begin, and how did you ensure the project's success?
5. Tell me about a time you made a mistake that impacted other people (teammates, a project timeline, etc.)
6. Tell me about a time you took initiative to improve something that wasn't explicitly your responsibility.
7. Tell me about a time you had to learn something completely new quickly in order to complete a task.
8. Tell me a time you had to give someone difficult feedback.
9. Tell me about a time you had to manage multiple high-priority tasks at once.
